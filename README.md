# Problem Description:
Our task is to model and build a relational database for the general operations of a golf club company. The primary entity is the golf resort, each physical golf course that the company owns and operates at different locations around the company (EX -> The Trump National Golf Resorts). The courses are run along with luxuries such as lessons, tee times, tournaments, retail opportunities, etc... that are offered to the guests that join or tag along with members of these clubs. We would like to model these relationships, input sample data, and populate each entity/attribute in an accurate manner. Lastly, we would like to write functional queries based on this database that provides important information for the Golf Resort and its daily operations.

# Data Model
Explanation:
The model we have created aligns with the structure of a theoretical golf resort company.
